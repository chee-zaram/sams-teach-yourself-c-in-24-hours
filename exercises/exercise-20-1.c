/**
 * Q-A: The result of the program is a Dish Name which initialized to 9.95,
 * and since the name member of dish variable is of char type,
 * 9.95 is not within the range of its numeric values and saw displays
 * "fffffï¿½#@d Sour Chicken".
 * The reason for this initialization is because the last member of the union
 * to be initialized was price, and since the union only holds the value of one
 * member at a time, which happens to be the last member assigned a value,
 * all members will the hold the same value if printed after.
